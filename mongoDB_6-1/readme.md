## ✅ The First Project of Mongodb


1. MongoDB Cloud (Atlas)
   I do this work:
    - [ ]  SignUp in https://www.mongodb.com/
    - [ ]  Create a project named `PyDeploy`
    - [ ]  Create a cluster in the project with  the cluster1 name`
    - [ ]  Go to `Security > Database Access` and create a user with the name mori_momtaz
    - [ ]  Go to `Security > Network Access` and add your IP address 0.0.0.0
    (You can add `0.0.0.0` to open network access to all, It’s easy but unsecured)
3. PyMongo
    - [ ]  Install `pymongo` python package https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver (Star ⭐️ the repo)
    - [ ]  Import `pymongo`
    - [ ]  Create a database with the name of Move.
        
     
        
    - [ ]  Create a collection named `cast`
    - [ ]  Insert 10 best my favorite tv series characters to the `cast` collection with their information
        
       
        
    - [ ]  Select data from the `cast` collection with the length of `name` less than 5 characters.
4. MongoDB Docker
    - [ ]  Get mongodb docker image from dockerhub https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo
    - [ ]  docker pull mongo
