### **Objective**:

The goal is to set up the basic infrastructure for the eKYC project, which includes creating a FastAPI backend, a Streamlit UI, integrating MongoDB for data storage, Redis for task management, and configuring Celery for background tasks. Docker will be used to containerize and manage these services.
