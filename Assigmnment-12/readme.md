In this work, an app designed by Flask, we have simulated facial analysis using artificial intelligence. 
in which the DeepFace repo is used. Its Github address is placed in the box below. Due to the large volume of weights, 
only the weights used to determine the age of the person were used.
```
https://github.com/serengil/deepface
```
Bootstrap has been used in the design of web pages, whose address is as follows:
```
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/
```
For install requirements run this:
```
pip install  -r requirements.txt
```
2. **BMR Calculator**
    
    We use energy no matter what you're doing, even when sleeping. The **BMR Calculator** will calculate your **Basal Metabolic Rate** (BMR); the number of calories you'd burn if you stayed in bed all day.
    
    If you've noticed that every year, it becomes harder to eat whatever you want and stay slim, you've also learned that your BMR decreases as you age. 🧬 Likewise, depriving yourself of food in hopes of losing weight also decreases your BMR, a foil to your intentions. 
    
    However, a regular cardiovascular exercise routine can increase your BMR, improving your health and fitness when your body's ability to burn energy gradually slows down. 🏋🏻
