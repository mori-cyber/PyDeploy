*In the third part of the API course, we deployed an API using the render website. The important point is that in the code folder, in addition to our code file, the installation requirements in the code should also be placed in a requirements file. In the Start Command section of the rendering website, our host should be set to 0.0.0.0 and our port should be set to 10000. Some of the outputs will be as follows.
