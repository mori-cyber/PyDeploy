* In this exercise, we have designed an API that takes the names of stars and provides information about them to the user. The render website has been used to deploy this API. The important points are that: A: Along with the Python code file, the requirements file must also be included. B: In the settings of the rendering website, you must first select the web service and then upload the desired code from GitHub, and also host on 0.0.0.0 and set the port number to 10000 ✔️.
