Hello dear friend
this is Python for  the Deployment course
we learned in Section 1:
what is an API token?
For more practice, we do 3 tasks:

1- for the first task we Designed the weather conditions of Mashhad city in Razavi Khorasan province of Iran. For this task, 
for the front-end, we have used  QTcreator. Back-end work has been done using the Python programming language in the VS Code environment. 
Here you can see a picture of the work output:

2- for the second task, we do the:
1. Using different programming languages to use an API
    - [ ]  Choose your favorite programming language
    - [ ]  Write some codes to use 4 different APIs (e.g. Fruit üçâ, Number üî¢, Harry Potter ‚ö°Ô∏è, Quran)
  I do 4 APIs  using c# language in vscode environment:
a) fruit - banana
b) number -20
c) Harry Potter
d) dictionary - book

3- for the third task, we do the:
- [ ]  Find a new API with Auth token
- [ ]  Test it
I do Bitcoin API

##API-2-ASSIGNMENT-2:  
In the second session of the API lesson, we learned how to obtain the information of a sample through the validation key, and for example, through the API of a plant, we were able to access the information of that plant. Also, we got to know how to make an API in a simple way and from scratch, and we were able to print a phrase of Hello World, and we were also able to learn how to print the information of a request. In the following, we were able to access the information of followers and followers through API gates, etc. Stay with us to learn more.
Part of the outputs:

*In the third part of the API course, we deployed an API using the render website. The important point is that in the code folder, in addition to our code file, the installation requirements in the code should also be placed in a requirements file. In the Start Command section of the rendering website, our host should be set to 0.0.0.0 and our port should be set to 10000. Some of the outputs will be as follows.
