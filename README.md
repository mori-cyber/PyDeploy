For more practice, we have done the following exercises 1- Exercise one: Designing the weather conditions of Mashhad city in Razavi Khorasan province of Iran. For this task,

for the second practice, we do the:
1. Using different programming languages to use an API
    - [ ]  Choose your favorite programming language
    - [ ]  Write some codes to use 4 different APIs (e.g. Fruit üçâ, Number üî¢, Harry Potter ‚ö°Ô∏è, Quran)
  I do 4 APIs  using c# language in vscode environment:
