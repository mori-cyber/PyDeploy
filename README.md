Hello dear friend
this is Python for  the Deployment course
we learned in Section 1:

For more practice, we do 3 tasks:

1- for the first task we Designed the weather conditions of Mashhad city in Razavi Khorasan province of Iran. For this task, 
for the front-end, we have used  QTcreator. Back-end work has been done using the Python programming language in the VS Code environment. 
Here you can see a picture of the work output:

2- for the second task, we do the:
1. Using different programming languages to use an API

##API-2-ASSIGNMENT-2:  
In the second session of the API lesson, we learned how to obtain the information of a sample through the validation key, and for example, through the API of a plant, we were able to access the information of that plant. Also, we got to know how to make an API in a simple way and from scratch, and we were able to print a phrase of Hello World, and we were also able to learn how to print the information of a request. In the following, we were able to access the information of followers and followers through API gates, etc. Stay with us to learn more.
