# How to run Python code in the Liara environment:

1- First, we install Docker
```
[https://desktop.docker.com/mac/main/arm64/Docker.dmg?utm_source=docker&utm_medium=webreferral&utm_campaign=dd-smartbutton&utm_location=module&_gl=1*1fa7fm*_ga*MjAxOTg3MDcyOC4xNzEyODE4MTM0*_ga_XJWPQMJYHQ*MTcxMzIyMDMzNy4yLjAuMTcxMzIyMDMzNy42MC4wLjA.](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)
```
2- We make a folder (Assignment_5)
3- In this folder, we create two files, requirements and Dockrfile
4- We create a folder named app inside the previous folder and put the code file and database in it.
5- We use an attractive image
6- We make a container from the image
